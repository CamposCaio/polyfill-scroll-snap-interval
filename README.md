# Polyfill Scroll-Snap Interval

Simple implementation of snap-scroll feature, using _setInterval()_ for better compatibility between browsers.

Basically, the script watches the scroll position and performs scroll alignment only when the user stops scrolling.

The script accepts different heights of sections as long as all sections are the same height.
